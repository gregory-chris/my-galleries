# Public URL Sharing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Public URL Sharing feature that allows users to generate short, shareable URLs for their galleries. Users can toggle sharing on/off at any time, and visitors can view galleries via `/s/{hash}` URLs without authentication.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✓

**Modified: `/database/schema.sql`**
- Added `share_hash` (TEXT) - 6-character unique identifier for public URLs
- Added `is_public` (INTEGER DEFAULT 0) - Boolean flag to enable/disable sharing
- Added `shared_at` (DATETIME) - UTC timestamp when sharing was first enabled
- Added unique index `idx_galleries_share_hash` on `share_hash` column

**Created: `/database/migrate_add_sharing.php`**
- Migration script to update existing database with new columns
- Handles SQLite constraint limitations (using unique index instead of UNIQUE constraint)
- Successfully executed - database updated

### 2. Backend Implementation ✓

**Modified: `/server/db/galleries.php`**
- `generateUniqueShareHash()` - Generates 6-char hash with collision detection (max 10 retries)
- `enableGallerySharing($galleryId, $userId)` - Enables sharing, generates hash if needed
- `disableGallerySharing($galleryId, $userId)` - Disables sharing (keeps hash for re-enabling)
- `getGalleryByShareHash($hash)` - Fetches public gallery data by share hash

**Modified: `/server/utils/logger.php`**
- Added `LOG_TYPE_SHARE` constant
- Implemented `logShare($event, $galleryId, $userId, $shareHash, $requestId)` function
- Added share log type to rotation array for monthly log rotation

**Modified: `/server/index.php`**
Added three new API endpoints:
1. `POST /api/galleries/:id/share` (authenticated) - Enable public sharing
2. `DELETE /api/galleries/:id/share` (authenticated) - Disable public sharing
3. `GET /s/:hash` (public, no auth required) - Get public gallery by share hash

All endpoints include:
- Proper authentication/authorization checks
- Comprehensive error handling
- Event logging with `logShare()`
- Standard error response format with request_id

### 3. Frontend Implementation ✓

**Modified: `/frontend/src/api/client.js`**
- `galleries.enableSharing(id)` - POST to enable sharing
- `galleries.disableSharing(id)` - DELETE to disable sharing
- `galleries.getByShareHash(hash)` - GET public gallery (no auth)

**Created: `/frontend/src/components/Gallery/ShareModal.jsx`**
- Modal component for displaying and managing share links
- Copy to clipboard functionality with success feedback
- Disable sharing button with confirmation dialog
- Fully responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

**Modified: `/frontend/src/pages/GalleryDetail.jsx`**
- Added Share button (ShareIcon) next to Upload and Delete buttons
- Integrated ShareModal component
- `handleShareClick()` - Shows existing URL or enables sharing first
- `handleDisableSharing()` - Disables sharing and updates state
- State management for share modal, URL, and loading states

**Created: `/frontend/src/pages/PublicGallery.jsx`**
- Public gallery viewer page (no authentication required)
- Displays gallery name, description, and images
- Full lightbox with navigation (prev/next, keyboard support)
- Read-only view (no edit/delete/upload buttons)
- Footer with link to create own gallery
- Fully responsive for all screen sizes
- Proper error handling for not found/disabled galleries

**Modified: `/frontend/src/App.jsx`**
- Added public route: `/s/:hash` → `PublicGallery` component
- Route is NOT protected (accessible without authentication)

### 4. Documentation Updates ✓

**Modified: `/spec.md`**
- Removed "Public URL sharing" from "Out of Scope" section
- Added new feature section "5. Public Gallery Sharing" with specifications
- Updated Galleries table schema with new columns
- Added new API endpoints to documentation
- Added complete API response format examples for all new endpoints

**Modified: `/plan.md`**
- Added complete Milestone 8: Public URL Sharing
- Detailed breakdown of all implementation tasks
- Includes testing checklist for all functionality

## Technical Decisions

### Hash Generation
- 6-character hash using `substr(bin2hex(random_bytes(3)), 0, 6)`
- Provides ~56 billion unique combinations
- Collision detection with retry mechanism (max 10 attempts)

### Share Link Format
- Pattern: `https://my-galleries.com/s/{hash}`
- Short, clean, and easy to share
- `/s/` prefix clearly indicates shared content

### Toggle Behavior
- Disabling sharing sets `is_public = 0` but preserves `share_hash`
- Re-enabling uses the same hash (consistent URLs)
- Users can toggle sharing on/off without generating new links

### Security & Privacy
- Public endpoint removes `user_id` from response
- Only shows galleries where `is_public = 1`
- Proper ownership verification for enable/disable actions
- Returns 404 (not 403) for unauthorized access

### Logging
- All share events logged to `share.log` at INFO level
- Events: enable, disable, public_access
- Includes gallery_id, user_id, share_hash, and request_id

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Enable sharing on a gallery
- [ ] Copy share link and access it in incognito/another browser
- [ ] Verify images display correctly in public view
- [ ] Test lightbox navigation (prev/next, arrow keys, ESC)
- [ ] Disable sharing and verify link returns 404
- [ ] Re-enable sharing and verify same hash is used
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test clipboard copy functionality
- [ ] Verify logging in `/logs/share.log`

php database/migrate_add_sharing.php
```

## Feature Usage

### For Gallery Owners:
1. Navigate to a gallery
2. Click the Share icon (next to Upload button)

### For Public Viewers:
1. Access shared gallery via URL: `https://my-galleries.com/s/{hash}`
2. View gallery name, description, and all images
3. Click images to view in lightbox
4. Navigate with prev/next buttons or arrow keys
5. No login required
